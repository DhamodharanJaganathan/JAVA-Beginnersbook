		<description><![CDATA[Hi Datt, I guess Chaitanya meant : “When a programmer makes any mistake such as wrong method name, wrong parameter types while overriding and if annotation is not used, programmer won&#039;t know as the compile time error won&#039;t be thrown. And the sub class method would behave as a new method (not the overriding method) in sub class”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chaitanya, I would require a clarification from you with respect to the override annotation. You have above quoted as &quot;If you don’t use the annotation then the sub class method would behave as a new method (not the overriding method) in sub class&quot;. Because the subclass is already extending the parent class, ideally (without providing annotation) the method however will get overriden as per my understanding when it has implementation. Based on this, Can you please explain me the point sub-class method behaving as new method.]]></description>
