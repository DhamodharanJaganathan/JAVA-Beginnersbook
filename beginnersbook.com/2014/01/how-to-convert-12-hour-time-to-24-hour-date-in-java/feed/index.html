Answer for reason for try-catch block:
Since the input in the program is hardcoded, technically we wouldn&#039;t need a try catch block here, however no program in any world would hardcode a value like this. And hence, the developer has thought in advance that the input will definitely be parameterized. That means, there is a margin for error which is why we have the try-catch block!! Hope I&#039;m clear!!]]></description>
