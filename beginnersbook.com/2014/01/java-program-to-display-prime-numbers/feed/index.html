		<description><![CDATA[very well explained,i m stuck in one part,say i am using scanner to take entry from user,now if i want this scanner input entry from user again n again without re running the program how can i do.
please suggest
thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[look at this declaration

String  primeNumbers = &quot;&quot;;

primeNumbers is declared as of type String so,

whenever new prime number is found its been appended to the same string with white space in between. (would have used array rather)

primeNumbers = primeNumbers + i + ” “;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[primeNumbers = primeNumbers + i + &quot; &quot;;

if you see this you would see a space between double quotes. This basically add the space . if you increase it the space between the number will increase .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For those of you wanting an explanation on whats going on in here, here it goes!

He is reading a number from standard input: (Console)

Then you are looping from 1 up to the n provided, i.e n=5, 1,2,3,4,5. 
Then you&#039;re trying to only append the primes to the string.
Recall a prime number, are those numbers that can only be divided by 1 and itself. 
He then starts looping through the current number, until he reaches 1. Counting the number of times the current number was evenly divided. 
for example, current number is 5, then he loops going back from 5 until 1. 
5,4,3,2,1. During each iteration, he then checks to see if the current number, in this example 5, is evenly divisible by any other number (i%number ==0)
5%5==0, true, increment counter
5%4==0, false, 
5%3==0, false,
5%2==0, false
5%1==0, true, increment counter

At this point, only 2 numbers evenly divided 5, therefore, 5 is prime!
We now append the current number to our string. 

Hope this helped!!

Oh and for that person that asked if it&#039;s better to use a stringbuffer, well yes! Strings are immutable, therefore, every time you are appending a value to it, you are creating a new string object!]]></description>
