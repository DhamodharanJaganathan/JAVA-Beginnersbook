		<description><![CDATA[They help you define a template for the sub classes. Abstract method is always in abstract class and when you extend the abstract class, you have to implement that method in your sub class else you will get compilation error. Which means you are defining a template for the sub classes. For example:
You want your sub classes to have a method disp() but at the same time, you want it to be different for each class. Then you declare this method abstract in parent class. This way all the sub classes will have to implement this method and give their own implementation.
I recommend you to read the abstract class tutorial (link provide in the above guide).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This might be very old, but I&#039;m trying to understand the necessity of the abstracts methods, there are more ways to get the same result, like deleting the interface, not implementing it, changing both methods to static and just printing the methods for example 1, like this:

class Demo{

   public static int sumOfTwo(int num1, int num2){
	return num1+num2;
   }
   public static int sumOfThree(int num1, int num2, int num3){
	return num1+num2+num3;
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
	System.out.println(sumOfTwo(3, 7));
	System.out.println(sumOfThree(4, 3, 19));
   }
}

So, my question is why and when do you really need abstract methods? What is it that they can do that no other nonaccess modifier can do?]]></description>
