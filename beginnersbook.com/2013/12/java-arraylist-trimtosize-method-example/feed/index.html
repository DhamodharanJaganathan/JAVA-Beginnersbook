		<description><![CDATA[@Lathy, There is a difference between size and capacity of an ArrayList. Size is the number of data items stored in an ArrayList. Capacity is the length of the Array that is used internally by the ArrayList. For obvious reasons, Capacity is always maintained greater than or equal to the Size. The trimToSize() method is used in situations where you know the ArrayList size is not likely to increase and you do not want to waste more memory space. Look up the implementation of ArrayList for more info.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I ran your code. It prints the same result whether trimToSize() method added or removed. 
I even checked the size of the arraylist with and without trimToSize() method but in both case it remains same.
Can you please check and update.]]></description>
