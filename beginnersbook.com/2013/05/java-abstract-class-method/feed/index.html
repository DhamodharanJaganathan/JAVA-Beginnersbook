		<description><![CDATA[Why does one needs abstract class ?  Animal class example has been given here. But can someone , please give me  practical example where this is useful. If I am writing a java application, when should I stop writing all the logica in concrete class and start using the  abstract class concept]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Abstract class can have concrete method,&#038; yes we cannot create object,but if you extend ur abstract class by any other class so through inheritance child get all the method(concrete method also of parent class) here dynamic polymorphism is achieved by using reference of parent u can call that concrete method of parent class,&#038; if u dont want that parent method just override that concrete method of that parent class in child class.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uday unfortunately you cannot access the concrete methods of an abstract class unless you extend the class. An abstract class is actually almost useless on their own. You can see an abstract class like a lazy student who has to be told to read his books; if he doesn&#039;t get told, he won&#039;t be able to read his books. Telling the student is now analogous to extending the abstract class and the student then reading his books is analogous to the execution of the concrete methods if you like.]]></description>
