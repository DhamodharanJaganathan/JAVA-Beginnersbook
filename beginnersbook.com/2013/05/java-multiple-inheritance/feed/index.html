		<description><![CDATA[We need interface because it gives order to must implement its requirements.
Example:
  If you have 2 shops, one shop is required ISO-9000 certifiction then you&#039;ll just inherit its class with ISO-9000 interface in order to fullfill their requirements. Where ISO-9000 interface contains all the requirements which one must have to implement before got certified.
That is why one class can inherit with multiple interfaces because your shop can have multiple certifications.
I hope now you&#039;ll understand the use of interfaces.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice explanation.
I have question,
Some people says  interface supports only syntax of multiple inheritance does not supports implementation of multiple inheritance
Is it true?if yes then how?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What if interface x and interface y&#039;s methods have different return types? Apparently it&#039;s legal because it&#039;s not a part of the method signature. How would you deal with that?]]></description>
