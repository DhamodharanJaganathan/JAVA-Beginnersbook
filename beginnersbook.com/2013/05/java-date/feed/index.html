		<description><![CDATA[The whole internet has tons of example wherein a date value is input into a &quot;string Type&quot; or &quot;int type&quot; and then using formatting classes &quot;converted&quot; into a Date type. Does it mean that Java has no direct capability like many other languages to take input directly into a &quot;date&quot; type variable using scanner class or any other type of input class. Maybe i have used other types of business development languages that allow one to input a date value into a date &#039;type&#039; variable and validate it. Its extremely strange to me that i don&#039;t see such examples in Java. Is there a way to do this at all in Java ? and why does it not exist anyway as a simple way to inut into Java ? And what are the different ways that i can input something in the date format as &quot;mm/dd/yyyy&quot; and then validate it ?

Thanks.]]></description>
