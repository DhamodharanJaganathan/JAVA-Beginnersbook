		<description><![CDATA[Hi, In the 2nd example. In the comment section, you have written &quot; this() is used for calling the default  constructor from parameterized constructor.&quot; 

I believe,  this() is used to call no-argument constructor from parameterized constructor.

Correct me, if i am wrong!!!!. 

This is one of the best website i found to learn java effectively. Keep up the good work!!.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi...the explanation is very simple and useful.
I have few questions.

1.What if child class&#039;s constructor is being called and it&#039;s parent class does not a default constructor(which is expected to be called implicitly)? Will complier throw error?

2.if child class&#039;s default constructor is being called,where first statement is this(parameter);
Will this call parent&#039;s default constructor first and then will invoke parametrized constructor of current object?

3.if in child&#039;s default constructor which is being called first statement is super(); and second is this();
Will this work in anyway?if yes then how?
Or then it will throw compilation error as both the statement&#039;s requirement is to be first statement.]]></description>
