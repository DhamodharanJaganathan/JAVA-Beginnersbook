		<description><![CDATA[Hi, first of all I would like to thank you for this great tutorial, Its really helpful for me to prepare for the interviews.
I have a query on the topic &quot;Diff b/w include directive and include action tag&quot;. I am writing here as I am unable to find the comments box over there. You mentioned that for include directive, the jsp wil included during translation phase whereas for include action tag it will be at runtime. My query is for include action tag, when the included JSP will get translated?]]></description>
