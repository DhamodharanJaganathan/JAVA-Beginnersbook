		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chaitanya,
I am confused after watching request handling architecture here . As per my understanding request from browser first handled by jsp container which converted jsp into servlet and then compiled servlet class executed and send back response to client through web container. So jsp must be on second step of architecture. Please clarify soon.

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Zoyeb,

Thanks for stopping by. Here are the answers:
1) No we cannot implement an interface in a JSP page. We are only allowed to extend a class in JSP using extends attribute of page directive &lt; %@ page extends=&quot;somePackage.SomeClass&quot; %&gt;
2) The major two differences between ServletContext and ServletConfig are as follows:
a) ServletConfig gets created every time during creation of a Servlet while ServletContext gets created only once per web application.
b) ServletConfig is used to access the ServletContext while ServletContext is used to access the server information.
3) This is how you can disable the session on a JSP page:
&lt; %@ page session=&quot;false&quot; %&gt; 
Setting up the session attribute of page directive to false. I have already covered this in the page directive section of this tutorial.]]></description>
