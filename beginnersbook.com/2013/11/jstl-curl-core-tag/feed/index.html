		<description><![CDATA[Hi, its a nice work this site.
I&#039;m a beginer with jsp and javaee deveop and I find very useful this posts.
I have a question, about the use of c:url, I found a situation in which c:url is not working, in the next code:




&#060;img src=&#034;&quot; alt=&quot;Fotografia&quot; class=&quot;img-thumbnail img-responsive&quot; title=&quot;Fotografia&quot; /&#062;

The c:url does not add the context of my app, I  am using c:url in a lot of other places in my views and it works perfectly just here not, and the only difference is the value comes from a property of a bean. Is there an special thing I have to do in this case or am I doing anything worng?]]></description>
