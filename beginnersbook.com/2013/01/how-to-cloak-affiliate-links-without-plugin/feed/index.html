		<description><![CDATA[Great article with helpful tips. I have now set up the cloaking, but I was wondering about the following. Since all the links are redirects, it takes some seconds to load the links. Therefore I would like to show an &quot;exit page&quot; that says something like: Just waiting to redirect you to.. (shop name).. just a few seconds..

Do you have a tip on how to show an exit page like that?]]></description>
