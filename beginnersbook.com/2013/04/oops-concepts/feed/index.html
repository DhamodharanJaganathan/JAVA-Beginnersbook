		<description><![CDATA[I have a question regarding protected access specifier.In this article it&#039;s given that &quot;protected: The scope of a protected variable is within the class which declares it and in the class which inherits from the class (Scope is Class and subclass)&quot;. To my knowledge, Protected means Package level and Subclass level access(in Java). Could you please comment on this..
Your articles are simple and very much helpful. Really appreciate your effort... 
Thank you]]></description>
