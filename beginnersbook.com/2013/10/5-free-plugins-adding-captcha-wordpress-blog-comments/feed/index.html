		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this helpful discussion. I came across it while goggling as I just migrated from blogger to wordpress and guess what. a site as been terrorizing me with kinds of comment that got me pissedoff and so, I decided to search out solution. 
Just yesterday I went through 26 comments and less than 8 was meaningful and approveable, others were total junks and I turned them to spam and got them deleted instantly.
will try out these plugins and see if it works well as said.
