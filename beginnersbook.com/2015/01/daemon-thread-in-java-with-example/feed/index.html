		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I&#039;m sorry this may appear a silly question, but, it sounds like according to definition described, the daemon thread does not continue running in the background, which is what it should do. the JVM will terminate the daemon thread then shutdown itself. I guess I am a little confused, because daemons are to stay alive and keep running in background. I need this behavior. Can someone help explain this to me? It seems that one can make the user thread will stay alive and the daemon will terminate by nature. I need to create a daemon that will continue to monitor things and run continuously in the background, of course go to sleep for 3 minutes and then wake up, do its thing, then go back to sleep. over and over again. What am I missing? thanks so much!
