		<description><![CDATA[Yes, your website makes a good point! However, I would suggest carefully exploring the websites HTML code in depth. For instance, if your  adding a link to a directory, you need to identify the link location area within the HTML code.  Some links on website - appear as  rel=&quot;no follow&quot; while others are &quot;do follow&quot;.    There are add-ons for fire fox brower which identify no follow links - but again you need to explore the HTML code.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually the ability to identify whether a link is dofollow or nodofollow is somehow difficult for newbies and those with no knowledge of coding. one of the major confusion is that most people believe that any comment love enabled sites are dofollow. Like what Cris said, his method will only work on PC. So, what will mobile users do to identify it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you must use &#039;Nofollow&#039; to stop Google following the link or giving PageRank to the target link,  it is logical that without that attribute Google would follow the link and provide so-called &#039;link juice&#039;

If Google&#039;s default, therefore, is to &#039;follow&#039;, where is the need to use the &#039;Dofollow&#039; attribute?  Surely it&#039;s reduntant and therefore has no use at all?  There is nothing between &#039;Nofollow&#039; and &#039;Dofollow&#039; so one or the other is unnecessary!  Comments?]]></description>
