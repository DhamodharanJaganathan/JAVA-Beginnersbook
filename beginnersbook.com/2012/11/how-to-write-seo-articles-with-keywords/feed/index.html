		<description><![CDATA[M confused of using subheadings bcoz i simply copy my whole title n paste it as subheadings. For example

i give blog title : How to Drive Car
now my post starts

subheadings : How to Drive Car
description......m doing right or wrong plz tell me, if wrong then tell me how i write subheadings with keyword differ from title.
one more thing m asking, that meta description in blogger is for whole blog not for single post. for single post their is search description column in the right side when we posting a new post. so plz tell me it is good to give search description or not. bcoz i had seen if we not give the search description the Google will take the first 145 character of the published post automatically. plz clear my thoughts, thanks.]]></description>
