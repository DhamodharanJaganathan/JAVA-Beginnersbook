		<description><![CDATA[Great Articles, You simple explained the use of LSL keywords. I am new to this term but now i am sure that i&#039;ll use it on my blog. The plugin you mentioned I have used earlier but that time I was unable to understand its importance but now i will use it again. Thank you so much once again. You also mentioned about keyword density but i am still confused:

1. What keyword Density should be for &#039;focus keyword&#039; and &#039;Lsl Keyword&#039;?
2. Is it okay if I use more than one &#039;LSL keyword&#039; for a single post?

Please answer me as soon as possible, Looking forward for your reply. It will be a great favor. Thanks once again.]]></description>

You have explained many things in just a single post and done a great job. In Future I will be looking at your website if, I have to get any information about new things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chai,
A very informative article on Latent Semantic Indexing (aka LSI) keywords. 
I have been using EasyWPSEO plugin to search for LSI keywords for long. But was not very much aware about the whole concept. It is until today when I have started searching for some info on that &#038; landed to your post. 
You have made the concept very easy to understand. Thanks for sharing. 
It will be great if you can highlight on the topic whether we can depend on EasyWPSEO plugin on current context or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i have spent more than 3 months as a blogger now and have discovered this word first time in my SEO search :) . Anyways this is really a key concept and the explanation to the concept is really great. You have give the example of the same blog that you are writing upon. This makes it great and easy to Understand. 

I have one different question in mind, i have heard a lot about writing long length articles for better optimization but does writing extra long article like 2000+ words have negative a impact ?? Or it is just a one way ride, write as large as you can.]]></description>
