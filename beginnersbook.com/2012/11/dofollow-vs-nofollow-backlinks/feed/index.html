		<description><![CDATA[Well, according to my experiments, which i did in last few months, Nofollow Links does pass any link juice directly, but if those Nofollows are from authority sites and are from the body of the post, then it can help in ranking. But still, haven&#039;t able to find the perfect conclusion. So, I think, we should not built nofollow links intentionally, as it cannot help directly to ranking.

I may be wrong. What you think about this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Chaitanya..
For this nice informative and simply written article !
I got to learn the difference btwn these two !

And i would like to add....try and give dofollow links to high authority sites in your niche and dofollow links that would just be a mere refference. 
It will help maintain your page value and make sure the link juice dosen&#039;t pass to other sites. 

Thank You :)]]></description>
